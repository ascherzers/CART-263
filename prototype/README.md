## Description

“EEG” is a surreal escape room game where players uncover secrets hidden in an ordinary-looking space. Through curious interactions, cryptic riddles, and strange objects, a seemingly normal room slowly reveals layers of mystery. Solve puzzles, collect items, and explore deeper into alternate realities—but beware, not everything wants to be found.
