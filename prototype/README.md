## Description

A blank background that experiments with the fading mechanics I will be using to transition between rooms, as it fades to black. Three hidden shapes are placed in the frame and when clicked on will reveal themselves and be interactable, each one having it's own feature. The sqaure being able to be dragged around, the triangle can be rotated when clicked on, and the circle can change colour when cicked on.
